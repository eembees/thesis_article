\section{Calculation of weights in a dilated stack similar convolutions}\label{appx:dilation-weights}

\subsection{Single Convolution}
For a normal 1D Convolution, we calculate the number of weights, \(N\), as: 
\[
N = \text{in\_channels}\cdot\text{out\_channels}\cdot\text{kernel\_size}
\]
With a kernel size 1024, and \(\text{in\_channels}=\text{out\_channels}=16\): 
\[
N=16\cdot16\cdot1024=2^{18}=262.144
\] 

\subsection{Stack of non-dilated convolutions}
The receptive field of a stack of 1D convolutions with the same kernel size is: 
\[
RF = \text{num\_layers} + \text{kernel\_size} -1
\]
For a receptive field of 1024 and a kernel size of 2, this requires $\text{num\_layers}=1023$. 

The number of parameters, $N$ in a stack of 1D convolutions (dilated or not) is:
\[
N = \text{num\_layers} * \text{in\_channels} * \text{out\_channels} * \text{kernel\_size}
\]
Here \(\text{kernel\_size}=2\), so: 
\[
N = 1023 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 2 = 523.776
\] 

\subsection{Dilated Stack}
Calculating the receptive field of a layer $l_i$ in a dilation stack:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
r_{l_0} &= 2 \\
r_{l_i} &= r_{l_i-1} + (\text{kernel\_size} - 1) \cdot d_i
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

A stack of 10 dilated layers, with exponentially increasing dilation (\(d_i\in \{2^0,2^2, ..., 2^9 \}\)) has a receptive field of 1024:
\[
r_{l_9} = 1 + \sum_{i=0}^9 2^i = 2^{10} = 1024 
\]


The number of parameters, $N$ is calculated similarly as above:
\[
N = \text{num\_layers} \cdot \text{in\_channels} \cdot \text{out\_channels} \cdot \text{kernel\_size}
\] 
Here \(\text{kernel\_size}=2\), so: 
\[
N = 10 \cdot 16 \cdot 16 \cdot 2 = 10 \cdot 2^{9} = \mathbf{5120}
\] 
With this in mind a stack of dilated convolutions is significantly more lightweight for acheiving large receptive fields, with two orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard stack with similar receptive field.
